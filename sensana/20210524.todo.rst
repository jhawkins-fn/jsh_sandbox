* Add basic perturbation function for methyl features

* Re-run with a more current (ideally “nearly final”) Additivity model
    * June 6: additivity model architecture lock

* Test with a protein-only model to evaluate the shift in outcomes outside methyl’s shadow

* Test a perturbation with covariances (i.e. off-diagonal non-zero values)

* Add 0.2, 0.5 CV variance runs
