NEXT STEPS
===

* When column field is named, use it in place of idx

* Verify that named columns exist in post_transformer_matrix_holder

* Verify that named columns are the ones which are varied after factory

* plot post_transformer_feature_value vs. score with annotation for coefficient

* Add 0.2, 0.5 CV variance runs


Correctness
---

* Carefully chase features through the classifier and ensure that we are
  correctly perturbing the exact set that ultimately impact classification
    * Correct tick-labels once this is confidently aligned

* Verify that non-”classifier-relevant” features do not impact classification.
    * (If they do, we may need to test with different training data.)

* Sanity check coefficient alignment with modified columns


Extensions
---

* Add basic perturbation function for methyl features

* Re-run with a more current (ideally “nearly final”) Additivity model
    * June 6: additivity model architecture lock

* Test with a protein-only model to evaluate the shift in outcomes outside methyl’s shadow

* Test a perturbation with covariances (i.e. off-diagonal non-zero values)

* Test perturbations with higher variance and compare
